1. Create a Server using Nodejs, 
	(i) Modify the server code to return a String of your choice
	(ii) Modify the Server code to output the requested object to the console using console.log

2. FileSystem -> using fsmodule
	(i) Create a Nodejs Program to output the current working directory (using fsmodule)
	(ii) Extend the code to the node server such that it can output the value of directory name
	(iii) Create a program which can read a file from the current working directory and output it to console ( after this it is advised to append some content in the same file)

3. 	(i) Create a Date Module. This module will tell the current date and time.(when we import this module it will tell date and time)
	(ii) Extend the code by creating a new module named as days left. (It should be able to give you the remaining number of days till a significant date from the current date (which can be imported from the first module Date))
	(iii) Take the code of days left and integrate with the node server. We should hit by using a URL and we should find the number of days between two dates.
